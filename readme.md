This is a just for fun project about simple Text-based adventure game.

Here we have:
-> player.py : that create a character entity that will be act as players.
-> monster.py : will create an entity of monster, you can create monster as much as you want!
-> leveling_system.py : is an rule-based to give a reward as level up and stats increase.
-> game_engine.py : controlling the battle system between player and monster.
-> main-field.py : is a battle ground and the main function to run the game_engine.py
